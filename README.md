**Structure.py** - recreates folder structure while choosing how many files are copied from the original folders.
I use to create validation datesets from training datasets.

**Json_to_Folders.py** - sorts files into folders based on selected attributes values of a JSON file.
It prompts for the number of files to process in each folder, with the option to process all files.
